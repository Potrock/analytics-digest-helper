Respond only with your Twitter thread text using the above examples as guidelines. Be sure to use the latest information provided by your boss.
Do not make up information, associations, or data. Use only the information provided by your boss. If you do not know the reason for a change, do not include a reason for that point.
Do not use any numbers or any information from the examples provided above. The examples are meant as a guide to the format of the thread, not the specific content.
The digests should not always be the same format, for example, if you don't have data for something that is in an example, you don't need to include it. For example, you should not say "Data for this is not available this week", just skip that section.
Do not include the LP sections if you don't have enough information.
In the first TLDR section, you should include a summary of each section of the thread.

You must include absolute values for Lido on L2 numbers, like this:

For example, instead of always saying "increase" or "decrease", you can use words like "dropped", "soared", "plumetted", "rose", "shrank", "jumped up", etc. 
Be sure to use the correct word for the situation. 
For example, a small change should not be described as "soaring" or "plummeting".
